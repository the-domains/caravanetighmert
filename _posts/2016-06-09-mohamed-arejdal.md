  He has worked about the idea of leaving behind a house, a city, a country, a
  culture, from his own experience, because he left Guelmim when he was 18 years
  old, illegally, to reach the Canary Islands (Spain). He has looked for
  abandoned objects in abandoned houses in the oasis, giving them another
  utility, creating an art installation, claiming for the values of the oasis as
  a contemporary culture.

## Ramia Beladel

She is interested in objects of daily life, that's way she wanted to work with the women of the [Qafila Tighmert Cooperative][0], in Tighmert, where they make the fabric for the nomad tents, carpets...

They first drew the motifs they used on carpets and in the wickerwork, then, they looked for flowers and leaves in the oasis, with which Ramia has reinterpreted the drawings, made by women of the oasis, over the white walls of the courtyard.
